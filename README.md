Compress the content of this folder and upload it to the [Cocoon cloud service](http://cocoon.io/ "Cocoon cloud service").

You need to install the InApp purchases plugin and make some configurations in your app for this demo to work. Check the InApp purchases plugin [documentation](http://docs.cocoon.io/article/google-play-store-plugin/ "Documentation") to know how to setup your application.

**Important:** This demo won't work as it is just compiling it. It requires that you set up your own application bundle id and all the prurchases settings. Read the guide above to know how to do it.
